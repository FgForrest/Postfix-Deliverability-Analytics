 * InputStream that handles log rotation. It will not return -1 on EOF. Instead it waits and continues reading.
 * When file is being rotated it behaves just if it found EOF and it returns -1. It is used together with SequenceInputStream
 * that is supplied new TailingInputStream (with the new file of the same name) when the old returns -1 (file rotated)
